# inventorli

Inventorli is a command line tool for everybody who likes to knows where he stowed away his stuff. You can simply manage your inventory and search for items.

Usually, you have a box or some other kind of container, put your stuff inside that box and stow it in the basement. A few weeks later (or problably months/years) you look for something and can't find it. That's the moment inventorli comes in very handy.


## How it works
Actually, inventorli does not save what is inside a box. Each box has it's own history, that tracks the movement of your items.
The history is represented by a list of transactions. Putting an item into the box is a transaction. Removing an item from the box is a transaction, too. 
This way of storing information about the content of a box gives you the possibility to track your stuff. This can be helpful if you want to know where your stuff got lost if somebody removed it from a box. You can then view the history of your box and go something like this:

"Where is my HDMI cable... \*starts viewing history\* Oh, I used it for my computer monitor."
